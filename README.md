## üöÄ Overview

Chameleon is a powerful web application designed to breathe new life into legacy codebases. By leveraging the analytical power of AI, it provides instant, in-depth analysis and modernization insights for archaic file types like COBOL and JCL and transforms them into Python code (.py files). Simply upload your files and let Chameleon reveal the underlying structure, logic, and potential for transformation.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-File Upload**: Upload multiple legacy files simultaneously for comprehensive project analysis.
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: A modern, user-friendly interface for easy file selection.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Utilizes a sophisticated Langflow backend to process files and extract meaningful insights.
- **Structured Results**: Presents analysis in a clean, readable format with collapsible sections for code and documentation.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Generated code is displayed with proper syntax highlighting for improved readability.
- **Responsive Design**: A fully responsive interface that works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vite, React, TypeScript
- **UI**: shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend AI Workflow**: Langflow
- **Syntax Highlighting**: `react-syntax-highlighter`

## üì¶ Getting Started

To get the application running locally, follow these steps:

### Langflow

- Download [langflow](https://www.langflow.org) and import the `.json` file avilable at `langflow-flows/cob_to_py_with_JIT.json` into your langflow application (flow)

- All the LLMs in the flow are powered by Mistral open-source models. Get your free API keys by signing-up at [mistral console](https://console.mistral.ai/).



### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- A running [Langflow](https://langflow.org/) instance on `http://localhost:7868`.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
    cd <PROJECT_DIRECTORY>
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Ensure your Langflow backend is running:**
    The application is configured to communicate with a Langflow service at `http://localhost:7868`. Make sure your Langflow instance is active and accessible.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

##  Usage

1.  Open the web application in your browser.
2.  Drag and drop your legacy cobal code files (e.g., `.cbl`, `.jcl`) onto the upload area in `.txt` format as langflow doesn't accept cobal file extensions at the moment, or click to select them from your file system.
3.  Once all desired files are selected, click the "Process Files" button.
4.  The application will upload the files, trigger the AI analysis on the backend, and display the structured results.
